                    <h4>Algorithm Development and Game Design</h4>
                    <p>In this project, I worked to create a 2d game in the Unity game engine. This required a knowledge of c#, game design principles, and algorithm development. The game play alone from a player perspective is nothing special; you play as a penguin that works through a maze to find a fish. The developmental achievement in this game was my own maze generation algorithm. If you are interested in how I developed this algorithm, I have a design explanation you can <a href="https://clydefrog04.github.io/PenguinLabyrinth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find here.</a></p>

We learned essential skills such as working in an agile environment, game design, algorithm design and git. This was my first time using git in a project daily.
